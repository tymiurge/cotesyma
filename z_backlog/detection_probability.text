@TODO: (S1) as a TM i want to see test probability to detect a bug in order to decide whether the test should be included in a test cycle
  - probability should be based on previous runs statistics
  - there should be ability to calculate failure detection probability for particular failure severity
  where? - in test cycle wizard, probably in test wizard
