@TODO as a quality contributor i want to subscribe on <entity> changes so that i'm kept informed on changes

list of entities:
- test
- report
- product status
- and whatever in general (generate stories later)

list of updates to be available in the top panel (bell + budges with number of updates)
? if update is VERY IMPORTANT the bell should be red until the change is seen
